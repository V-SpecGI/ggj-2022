Frog AI:

Flies will spawn at random spots. 5 at start and more as time progresses. Never have flyCount > 5.

Frog eats random fly from flyArray. One at a time. When eaten, spit fireball projectile at character (make cody do this)

If play hits frog when flyArray is not empty, player is pushed back. Croak animation.

When flyArray is empty, player can hit frog and frog takes damage. (frog hearts?)

Extra:
After croak, spawn two more flies. Faster attacks.
After second croak, spawn three more flies. Faster attakcks.
For faster attack: increase projectile speed and decrease time before fly eat.
